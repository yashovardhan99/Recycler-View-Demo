An android Kotlin sample of implementing Recycler View with onClick calls in Fragments. This sample project can be modified to suit your needs. I plan to maintain this project to help myself and others get a good place from where they can learn to use RecyclerViews in Kotlin.

## Motivation
I am planning to create a series of small sample android apps which can then be used when building a larger app. This is the second installment in this series. This project is also my first Kotlin project!

## Code Style
Try to follow the [AOSP Code style](https://source.android.com/setup/contribute/code-style) or the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). I know I won't be following them thoroughly though :wink:

## Specs
- Min SDK version : 19 (KitKat)
- Target SDK version : 28 (Android Pie)
- Compile SDK version : 28
- AndroidX repositories are used
- Data binding is enabled
- SafeArgs for Navigation is enabled
- Built with Kotlin!

### External Dependencies:-
- [Google Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-android)
- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/) Navigation (Android Architecture)
- Kotlin Standard Library


## Usage
To use this sample in your own project, you can either clone this repo and build a completely new app or you can take the relevant layouts and fragments you need. Either way, please give credit where due and use in accordance with the license.

## Tests
No Tests yet. If you could help create some, please open an issue!
